# Amazon-ML-Hackathon 2023
Product length is crucial for packaging and storing products efficiently in the warehouse. Moreover, in many cases, it is an important attribute that customers use to assess the product size before purchasing. However, measuring the length of a product manually can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially for large catalogs with millions of products.
<br>Hence, build a machine learning model that can predict product length from catalog metadata.
